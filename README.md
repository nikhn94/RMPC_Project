# Motion Planning and Control of an Autonomous Car for Pedestrian Avoidance
Abstract - Path planning for autonomous vehicles in various environments is an important problem, due to several constraints from vehicle dynamics and existence of surrounding vehicles. There are different methods for path planning such as RRT method, A* method and so on. In this paper, we perform path planning and obstacle avoidance of a car using Model Predictive Control (MPC). A car represented by a classical bicycle model is made to travel along the center lane of a road and maintain the trajectory. Two moving pedestrians are modelled as obstacles which the car avoids. After avoiding the obstacles, the car returns back to its original trajectory quickly with zero error.
